0–1	Signature	Must be "BM" (0x42 0x4D in hex)
2–5	File size	Size of entire file in bytes
6–9	Reserved	Usually 0
10–13	Pixel data offset	Where the pixel array starts (important!)
14–17	Header size	Should be 40 (for BITMAPINFOHEADER)
18–21	Width	Image width in pixels
22–25	Height	Image height in pixels (positive = stored bottom→top, negative = top→bottom)
26–27	Planes	Always 1
28–29	Bits per pixel	Common: 24 (BGR), 32 (BGRA)
30–33	Compression	0 = none (uncompressed BMP)
34–37	Image data size	Size of raw pixel array (may be 0 for uncompressed BMP)
38–45	Resolution	Pixels per meter (ignore if not needed)
46–53	Color table info	Only used for indexed color BMPs (≤8 bpp)

Each row is padded to a multiple of 4 bytes.
Pixels are always B, G, R order

Weighted luminance
gray = 0.299 * R + 0.587 * G + 0.114 * B
